### (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻

_yeet_ is an image caching and optimizing proxy, with support for uploading. I built it for [ellie.wtf](https://ellie.wtf)

- Upload images to S3 with curl
- Cached responses to keep S3 bill down
- Auto-optimize images for web

I'll clean this up and sort some docs soon, but I mostly just made it to solve my own problem + finish something small and simple.
